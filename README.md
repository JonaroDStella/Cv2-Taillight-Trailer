# Cv2-Taillight-Trailer
### tracking.py
It uses a CSRT tracker to track taillight. Then find contours for more accuracy. Finally, save the points to a file.
### manual.py
Sometimes, the tracker does work well. At this point, you can manually select the box.
### disaply.py
Reads points from the file and renders them. I suggest you code a render on your own.
